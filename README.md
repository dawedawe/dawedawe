### Greetings

I'm David aka dawe, a freelancing software engineer with a big :heart_on_fire: for functional programming and Rust.  
Currently, I'm focusing on the open source eco-system of F#.  
I'm a member of the [Amplifying F#](https://amplifying-fsharp.github.io/) initiative and a co-maintainer of various projects, e.g. [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas), [FSharp.Analyzers.SDK](https://github.com/ionide/FSharp.Analyzers.SDK) and regularly contribute to the [F# compiler](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp) itself.  
To further improve the F# developer experience, I also contribute to [FsAutoComplete](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete), [Ionide](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp) and other developer tools.

If you use any of these projects, think about [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/dawedawe) me to keep them healthy.
