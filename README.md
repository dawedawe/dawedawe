### Greetings

I'm David aka dawe, a freelancing software engineer and university educator with a big :heart_on_fire: for functional programming and Rust.  
Currently, I'm focusing on the open source eco-systems of Rust.  

If you use any of these projects, think about [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/dawedawe) me to keep them healthy.  

Centralized power is a huge problem, that's why I'm also active on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/dawe/).
